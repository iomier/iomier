## The four common archetypes of Staff-plus role
###  Tech Lead:
The Tech Lead guides the approach and execution of a particular team. They partner closely with a single manager, but sometimes they partner with two or three managers within a focused area. Some companies also have a Tech Lead Manager role, which is similar to the Tech Lead archetype but exists on the engineering manager ladder and includes people management responsibilities.
- comfortable scoping complex tasks
- coordinating their team towards solving them
- maintain many of the essential cross-team and cross-functional relationships
- close partner to the team’s product manager

> an organization needs roughly one Tech Lead for every eight engineers, making it far more common than other archetypes.
### Architect:
The Architect is responsible for the direction, quality, and approach within a critical area. They combine in-depth knowledge of technical constraints, user needs, and organization level leadership.

> **Architects are responsible for the success of a specific technical domain within their company, for example, the company’s API design, front-end stack, storage strategy, or cloud infrastructure.**

> The Architect role tends to evolve in relatively **large companies**, companies with exceptionally complex or coupled codebases, and companies that are struggling to repay the **technical debt** they created in their initial sprint to product-market fit

> Some companies push for Architects to remain deep in the codebase, and others set a clear expectation that Architects must not write code
### Solver:
The Solver digs deep into arbitrarily complex problems and finds an appropriate path forward. Some focus on a given area for long periods. Others bounce from hotspot to hotspot as guided by organizational leadership.

> the Solver generally operates on problems that are already identified as organizational priorities and thus are called on to do relatively little org-level chiropractics.

> they generally stop working on problems once they’re contained
### Right Hand 
The Right Hand extends an executive’s attention, borrowing their scope and authority to operate particularly complex organizations. They provide additional leadership bandwidth to leaders of large-scale organizations.

> Architect and Right Hand roles have generally emerged as the organizations reached one hundred and one thousand engineers, respectively
